Should I use Open edX?
======================

Open edX competitors include `Moodle <https://moodle.org/>`_, `Instructure’s Canvas <https://www.instructure.com/>`_, `Blackboard’s Open LMS <https://www.blackboard.com/>`_, as well as a slew of hosted, closed source alternatives. Open edX is the only online learning system that satisfies all following properties:

* Open source software to avoid vendor lock-in
* cales well in all directions (number of users and courses)
* Multiple extension points for comprehensive customization
* Modern, intuitive user interface to keep students engaged

Open edX is a safe bet: it is backed by edX.org, a US-based non-profit that is committed to open source and which runs Open edX to service its millions of learners. With Open edX you can be sure that the features you need will be available. If it’s good enough for Harvard, the MIT, or the French government, then it will probably also work for you.

Should I self-host Open edX or rely on a hosting provider?
==================================================================

Third-party Open edX providers can provide you with custom, closed-source features that they developed internally. However, their pricing is usually per-seat: that makes it difficult to predict how much running Open edX will actually cost you if you don’t know in advance how many students will connect to your platform. And once you start scaling up and adding many students, running the platform will become very expensive.
On the other hand, running Open edX on your own servers will help you keep your costs under control. Because you own your servers and data, you will always be able to migrate your platform, either to a different cloud provider or an Open edX service provider. This is the true power of the open source.
