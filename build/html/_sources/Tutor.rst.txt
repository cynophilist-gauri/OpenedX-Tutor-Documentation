What is Tutor?
---------------------

Tutor is the official Docker-based `Open edX <https://openedx.org/>`_ distribution, both for production and local development. The goal of Tutor is to make it easy to deploy, customise, upgrade and scale Open edX. Tutor is reliable, fast, extensible, and it is already used to deploy hundreds of Open edX platforms around the world.

Do you need professional assistance setting up or managing your Open edX platform? `overhang.io <https://overhang.io/>`_ provides online support as part of its `Long Term Support (LTS) offering <https://overhang.io/tutor/pricing>`_.

Should I use Tutor?
---------------------

Running software on-premises is cheaper only if your management costs don’t go through the roof. You do not want to hire a full-time devops team just for managing your online learning platform. This is why we created Tutor: to make it easy to run a state-of-the-art online learning platform without breaking the bank. Historically, it’s always been difficult to install Open edX with native installation scripts. For instance, there are no official instructions for upgrading an existing Open edX platform: the `recommended approach <https://docs.bitnami.com/azure/apps/edx/administration/upgrade/>`_ is to backup all data, trash the server, and create a new one. As a consequence, people tend not to upgrade their platform and keep running on deprecated releases. Tutor makes it possible even for non-technical users to launch, manage and upgrade Open edX at any scale. Should you choose at some point that Tutor is not the right solution for you, you always have an escape route: because Tutor is open source software, you can easily dump your data and switch to a different installation method.
